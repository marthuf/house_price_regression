# House price regression

In this project we use various linear regression models to predict house price using a popular training dataset from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).

This dataset describes individual residential property prices in Ames, Iowa from 2006 to 2010. It is an alternative to the well-known Boston Housing Data. A detailed description of the data can be found [here](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10691898.2011.11889627?src=recsys&).
